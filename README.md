# Tableau
For the purpose of this assignment, I merged datasets from July-September 2018 using Jupyter Notebook. 

First, download data from https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data and save them under Resources (they are large files and I could not upload on Github)

Then, run Citibike.ipynb file. The merged file will be located in the Output folder which is summer_df.csv. We can use this file to work in Tableau.

Next, using information provided in the dataset, create Dashboards and Story in Tableau. You may see the results in the Tableau Screenshots folder.
